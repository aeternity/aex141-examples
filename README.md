# NFT contracts and tooling
This repo contains standard contracts and tooling for Non-Fungible Tokens.

The `NFT.aes` contract is made with the purpose to be as close as possible
to the ERC-721 standard. Anyone being able to work with these contracts should
be able to work with the contract on Aeternity as well.
